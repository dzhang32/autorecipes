```{r setup, include = FALSE}

library(knitr)
library(tidyverse)
library(autorecipes)

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, eval = FALSE)
```

This .Rmd is designed to be run **interactively** and should not be knitted. 

# Setup 

## Conda environment

To run this .Rmd, you need to have a conda environment with [autogroceries](https://github.com/dzhang32/autogroceries) installed. 

```{r conda-env}
conda_env_name <- ""
```

## Credentials

[autogroceries](https://github.com/dzhang32/autogroceries) need your [Sainsbury's]() credentials. For security, it's recommended this is saved in a file rather than directly inputted into this script. 

The first line must correspond to your UN and the second your PW, no white space. 

```{r credentials}
credentials_path <- ""
```

## Output directory

Create the paths for outputting the `recipebook` and ordered products.

```{r output-dir}
output_dir <- ""
```

# autorecipes

## Initialise recipebook

```{r init-recipebook}
recipebook_path <- file.path(output_dir, "recipebook.rda")

if (file.exists(recipebook_path)) {
  load(recipebook_path)
} else {
  recipebook <- recipebook_example
}
```

## Set favourites

> Skip this step if you don't want to favourite any recipes. 

```{r set-fav}
# reset fav recipes
recipes(recipebook)[["fav"]] <- FALSE

# change method to "index" and add arg indexes if you wish to fav by index
recipebook <- add_favourites(recipebook, method = "manual")
```

## Create meal plan

```{r create-meal-plan}
# modify which_days, which_meals, method and fav_only to your liking
recipebook <- create_meal_plan(
  recipebook,
  which_days = weekdays(),
  which_meals = c("Lunch", "Dinner"),
  method = "auto",
  fav_only = TRUE,
  set_last_eaten = TRUE
)

meal_plan(recipebook)
```

## Create shopping list 

```{r create-shopping-list}
recipebook <- create_shopping_list(
  recipebook,
  filter_method = "minimal"
)

shopping_list(recipebook)
```

## Save recipebook

```{r save-recipebook}
save(
  recipebook,
  file = file.path(output_dir, "recipebook.rda")
)
```

# autogroceries

## Acivate conda env

```{r activate-conda-env}
conda_env_details <- reticulate::conda_list() %>%
  dplyr::filter(name == conda_env_name)

# important to set python path prior to library(reticulate)
# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50145643/unable-to-change-python-path-in-reticulate
Sys.setenv(RETICULATE_PYTHON = conda_env_details[["python"]])

library(reticulate)

reticulate::py_config()
```

## Shop

```{r shop}
shopper <- reticulate::import("autogroceries.shopper")

sb <- shopper$SainsburysShopper(
  items = shopping_list(recipebook)[["names"]][1:3],
  n_items = shopping_list(recipebook)[["n"]][1:3]
)

# load credentials
credentials <- readr::read_lines(credentials_path)

# setup output path
output_path <- file.path(output_dir, paste0(Sys.Date(), "-", "products.csv"))

products <- sb$shop(
  username = credentials[1],
  password = credentials[2],
  file = output_path
)
```
